# Audio-Processing
The initial milestone of this project was combining and matching random frequencies to create any tune. 
While the tune is playing, another, extra noise is created by pushing two random piano keys. 
To recreate the original sound, it was necessary to identify these two frequencies and filter the surrounding noise.
